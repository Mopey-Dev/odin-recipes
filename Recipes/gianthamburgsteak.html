        <li>Mix everything thoroughly</li>
        <li>Put mix in a large pan on the stovetop, recommend a 12 inch cast iron pan, & turn heat on to a little above low heat</li>
        <li>Put thin layer of olive oil or butter in the pan before putting in your beef mixture</li>
        <li>Compress meat into a big patty shape, including rounding off edges, as much as you can</li>

        <li>While wearing heat resistant oven mitts turn over pan used earlier & cover hamburger steak on plate then flip both together so patty is back in the pan with raw side down</li>
        <li>Put pan back on stovetop & cook the raw side again for 6 minutes</li>
        <li>After 6 minutes add about 250 milliliters of water into pan, enough to cover top of hamburger steak</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to medium then cover the pan with a lid; cook meat for about 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Check if meat is done by sticking a toothpick in middle & if it comes out clean it's done</li>
        <li>Transfer hamburger steak to a large plate then enjoy eating your 1 KG Warrior Honoring Hamburger Steak made by Frieren to honor the warriors she, Fern, and Stark are as well as Stark's birthday present.</li>
