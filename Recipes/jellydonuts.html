        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>As you might have guessed from the Gif thise Recipe is actually for Onigiri (Rice Balls). When Pokemon was localised <br>for the west many of the japanese
        food items were renamed to make the series more accesible for western audiences.<br>The most famous of these changes was in Episode 25 of the orginal series where Brock frequently refer to Rice balls as 'Jelly Filled Donuts</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Japanese Short-Grain Rice (KoshiHikari)</li>
            <li>Nori Seaweed</li>
            <li>Furikake</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
            <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
            <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
            <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
        </ol>
