        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>As you might have guessed from the Gif thise Recipe is actually for Onigiri (Rice Balls). When Pokemon was localised <br>for the west many of the japanese
        food items were renamed to make the series more accesible for western audiences.<br>The most famous of these changes was in Episode 25 of the orginal series where Brock frequently refer to Rice balls as 'Jelly Filled Donuts</p>
